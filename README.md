# ðŸ›  CAD Projects

Welcome to my collection of **CAD (Computer-Aided Design) projects**.  
This repository highlights my mechanical design, prototyping, and 3D modeling skills using tools such as *Fusion 360*

## ðŸ”§ What You'll Find
Each project folder includes:
- **Source CAD files** (`.f3d`, `.sldprt`, `.step`)
- **Export files** for 3D printing (`.stl`)
- **Renderings** for visual previews
